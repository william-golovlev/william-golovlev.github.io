Today is the day! I've released my first app on Google Play which can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rootedremedies.my_apothecary)!
(no iOS, sorry- I am not willing to pay 100/yr for a license when Google is 20/lifetime.)

I'll deep dive in AI tools and such which was used for creating this app as a solo developer/hobbyist later, but I just wanted to share the news here!
