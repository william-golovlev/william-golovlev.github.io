    <div class="content post-content"><p>As your SQL queries grow in complexity, they can become a messy tangle of subqueries and nested logic. This is where Common Table Expressions (CTEs) come in. Think of a CTE as a temporary, named result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.</p>

<p>While you might be used to using subqueries, CTEs are a huge step up because they make your code far more readable, organized, and reusable.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Basics: Introducing the WITH Clause</li>
</ol>

<p>A CTE is defined using the WITH clause, which comes at the beginning of your query. You give the CTE a name, define its contents, and then write your main query as if the CTE were a regular table.</p>

<p>Basic Syntax:
SQL</p>

<p>WITH your_cte_name AS (
SELECT column1, column2, â€¦
FROM your_table
WHERE condition
)
SELECT *
FROM your_cte_name;</p>

<p>Example:
Imagine we want to find the top 10% of customers by sales. Without a CTE, this can get complicated. With a CTE, we can first identify the total sales for each customer and then query that result.
SQL</p>

<p>WITH customer_sales AS (
SELECT
customer_id,
SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM
sales
GROUP BY
customer_id
)
SELECT
customer_id,
total_sales
FROM
customer_sales
ORDER BY
total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;</p>

<p>This is much cleaner than nesting a GROUP BY subquery directly into the FROM clause.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Intermediate Use: Chaining CTEs</li>
</ol>

<p>A single WITH clause can contain multiple CTEs, allowing you to break down a complex problem into a series of logical steps. This is where the power of CTEs really shines. Each subsequent CTE can reference any CTE defined before it in the same WITH clause.</p>

<p>Example: A Multi-Step Query
Letâ€™s find the average sales for a region, then find the products that sold above that average.
SQL</p>

<p>WITH
regional_sales AS (
SELECT
region,
AVG(amount) AS avg_regional_sales
FROM
sales
GROUP BY
region
),
product_performance AS (
SELECT
product,
region,
SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM
sales
GROUP BY
product,
region
)
SELECT
p.product,
p.total_sales,
r.avg_regional_sales
FROM
product_performance p
JOIN
regional_sales r ON p.region = r.region
WHERE
p.total_sales &gt; r.avg_regional_sales;</p>

<p>This multi-CTE approach makes the logic transparent and easy to follow, as each step is clearly defined.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Advanced Topic: Recursive CTEs ðŸ”„</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the most powerful and complex use of a CTE. A recursive CTE is a query that references itself. Itâ€™s designed to handle hierarchical or graph-like data, such as organizational charts, bill-of-materials, or social network connections.</p>

<p>A recursive CTE has two parts, connected by a UNION ALL:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The Anchor Member: The base query that provides the initial row(s) for the recursion. This part is not recursive.

The Recursive Member: The query that references the CTE itself to generate the next row(s). It continues to execute as long as new rows are being returned.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Example: An Organizational Chart
Letâ€™s say we have an employees table with employee_id and manager_id. We want to find the full management chain for a specific employee.
SQL</p>

<p>WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
â€“ Anchor Member: Find the starting employee
SELECT
employee_id,
manager_id,
employee_name,
1 AS level
FROM
employees
WHERE
employee_name = â€˜Aliceâ€™</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>UNION ALL

-- Recursive Member: Find the manager of the previous result
SELECT
    e.employee_id,
    e.manager_id,
    e.employee_name,
    o.level + 1 AS level
FROM
    employees e
JOIN
    org_chart o ON e.employee_id = o.manager_id
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>)
SELECT * FROM org_chart;</p>

<p>This query starts with â€˜Aliceâ€™ and then recursively finds her manager, then her managerâ€™s manager, and so on, until it hits the top of the chain (where manager_id is NULL).</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>Mastering CTEs is a crucial step in writing professional, maintainable SQL. They offer a powerful way to simplify complex queries, improve readability, and enable advanced techniques like recursion. By getting comfortable with the WITH clause, youâ€™ll be able to break down any analytical problem into a series of logical, easy-to-understand steps.</p>

<p>Ready to start? Try writing a query to find the average sales for each product category using a CTE. Then, try to find the top-selling product within each category in a single query using multiple CTEs.</p>
